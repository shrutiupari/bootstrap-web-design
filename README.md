Config files for my GitHub profile.

I am currently working on Bootstrap, Material Design to create resposive web sites. 
So far have created one sample website by going through some courses online which consists of pure bootstrap, html and css.

I hope if there is any chance of improvement please let me know so that I can keel learning.
